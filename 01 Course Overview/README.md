## Topic
In this first section, we're going to explore what you'll learn in this course. You'll learn why Javascript is a great language to know, and you'll explore what's covered in the class

There are no individual lecture notes for this first section. These lectures are important, but they don't cover any Javascript features.
        
## keywords & Notes
`In part one` you're going to learn the very basics of the language.Learn how to create a javascript file.We'll see how we can execute it and we're going to start using javascript to solve interesting problems.In part one you'll start building out hte to do and note taking applications .

`In part two` we're going to take what we already know about javascript and connect it to the browser.Be able to render stuff to the screen like the list of notes or to do's that haven't been completed and we're going to figure out how to respond to user interaction so users can click buttons or submit forms and we'll be able to do thing with that info.

This is where we're going to put the finishing touches on the to do and to note taking applications.

`In part 3` were going to start working on the hangman game as we explore `asynchronous programming` in javascript.This is going to allow us to connect our applications to the third part data sources so we can send data off to save it or we can request data whether it's something like a new puzzles for the hangman game, a list of the countries, a list of movies in the top 200 on  I MDD being able to connect your application with third party data sources is essential for creating something real world.

### Top quick tips and tricks 
This quick tips and tricks are going to help you get the most out of this course.
1. Tip 1: Write Code
The first of three tips has to do with you actually writing code.If you just watch the videos in the course and you don't write code you're going to get to the end of the  course and you're not going to know how javascript works and you won't be able to use it to land a job or build an application and that's not my goal for you. I want you to learn and understand javascript and to do that you need experience actually writing code and solving problems.

⋅⋅⋅So as we explore a new language feature I'm going to write some code that shows that feature off.We'll talk about the feature and we'll see how it works.Is your job to also write the code and run it.What I do through the course there are also *80 some odd challenges*. This is where I give you a little problem to solve.⋅⋅

⋅⋅⋅Thats going to give you real hands on experience solving problems with Javascript.⋅⋅

2. Tip 2: Ask Questions
The second thing I like to talk about is how you can ask questions.So as you move through the course you might get stuck maybe we install a program together but when you install it locally on your machine it doesn't install correctly.May be you follow along writing a script out but when you run it you don't get the same result I get.

⋅⋅⋅The more information you provide about what's going wrong the faster I'll be able to get your unstuck and get back on track.So if you're getting some sort of error message or other strange output take a screenshot of your screen and include that with your question.⋅⋅

⋅⋅⋅If your code isn't working correctly go ahead and zip up your project and include that with the question.The more information you can provide me about what you were doing when you saw the error . The better I'll be able to get you unstuck and back on track real quick.⋅⋅

3. Tip 3: Take Your Time
The last piece of advice I have  for you is to take your time working through the course.Learning is not a race.

⋅⋅⋅It would be very easy to blow through this course in 4 days.I simply stopped following along and I skip all the challenges.I watched the videos all day and I'm done in 4 days.The only problem is that when I'm done I haven't actually learned anything.⋅⋅

⋅⋅⋅That's is not my wish for you, it's going to take a bit more time ans that's is ok.⋅⋅

⋅⋅⋅I recommend coming up with a schedule that works for you.Maybe you can dedicate weekday evenings to the course or maybe you can dedicate Saturdays and Sunday morning to learning Javascript whatever it happens to be.⋅⋅

⋅⋅⋅Try to find a schedule and stick to it.It is truly the slow but steady that are going to win.⋅⋅

⋅⋅⋅Now there are other situation where you might want to think about your pacing as well.⋅⋅

⋅⋅⋅If you get really tired and you find yourself skipping challenges or not following along it's probably a good iead to take a break.Maybe take a day or two off go ahead and step outside or do something else for a little while.Then when you come back  you'll be recharged and ready to actually learn the language.It's not a race by the end.My goal for you is to actually learn and understand javascript.That might take three weeks or two months.Either way is good.⋅⋅

⋅⋅⋅Let's go ahead and continue on in the next videos.⋅⋅
