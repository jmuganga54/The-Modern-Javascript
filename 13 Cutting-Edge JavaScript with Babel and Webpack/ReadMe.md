## Topic
In this section we will be primarily going to be focusing on two tools `Babel` and `webpack` which are going to open up a world of new features for us to use. 

`Babel` is going to ensure that our applications work in a wide a range of browsers as possible even older browsers that are no longer being updated to support the latest cutting edge javascript features.

`Webpack` is going to open up a whole bunch of new features for us to use the biggest and best being the javascript `module system`.

This gives us a brand new way to structures our application code and I'm super excited to show you want it can do.

## Keywords and Notes
### The Problem Cross-Browser Compatibility
The goal of this section is to introduce a few new tools that are going to make it possible for our application to function in a wider range of browsers.

Like much older browsers that don't support the newer features or taking advantage of in this modern javascript bootcamp.

Illustration an example of this cross-browser incompatibilities. This video is all about exploring the problem. The rest of the section is all about the solution.

Let start with the really easy one, we're going head over to the browser and Google `mdn const`. Down below you can see `Browser compatibility Table`

So this browser incompatibilities for a feature is going to be big problem for us if we want to write modern javascript code and have our applications work everywhere. We are going to need to introduce a bit of tooling that tooling that we're going to introduce is going to solve those two key problems. 

The first problem `older browsers` are never going to update to support these newer features, so if ew want to use them which we do we have to figure out a way to work around that which we're going to.

The second problem is that there are newer javascript features out there that currently aren't supported by any browser or even the latest and greatest, so the tooling that we're going to set up is going to solve that problem too allowing us to use the most advanced, cutting edge features in the language.
