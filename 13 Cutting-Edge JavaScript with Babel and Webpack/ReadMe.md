## Topic
In this section we will be primarily going to be focusing on two tools `Babel` and `webpack` which are going to open up a world of new features for us to use. 

`Babel` is going to ensure that our applications work in a wide a range of browsers as possible even older browsers that are no longer being updated to support the latest cutting edge javascript features.

`Webpack` is going to open up a whole bunch of new features for us to use the biggest and best being the javascript `module system`.

This gives us a brand new way to structures our application code and I'm super excited to show you want it can do.
